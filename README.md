# Cryptography Playground

Hey there! This is my little workshop where I play around with cryptographic primitives like encryption, key exchanges, and digital signatures. Think of it as a sandbox where I build toy versions of cryptographic building blocks to understand how they work.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important note ‚ö†Ô∏è
These are just toy implementations I made for fun and learning - please don't use them for anything serious!

## What's inside? üß©
- Simple implementations of cryptographic primitives.
- Lots of comments explaining how things work.
- Educational examples and demos.
- Probably some bugs...

## Why did I make this? ü§î
I love tinkering with cryptography concepts to see how they work under the hood. While these implementations aren't secure enough for real use, they might help others learn about cryptography or spark some interesting ideas.

## Enjoy! ‚öôÔ∏è
